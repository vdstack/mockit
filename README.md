This is a fun little experiment I'm doing to build a lightweight Mokito inspired mocking library.

For now it's functional and allows you to mock out methods by returning custom values,
executing a custom function, or throwing a custom exception as well as a custom error message.

Next steps:

- [x] Check if the mock has been called.
- [x] Check if the mock has been called a specific number of times.
- [x] Check if the mock has been called with specific arguments.
- [x] Check if the mock has been called with specific arguments a specific number of times.
- [ ] Use prototype to generate mocks that cover all the functions of a class.
