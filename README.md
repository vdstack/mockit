This is a fun little experiment I'm doing to build a lightweight Mokito inspired mocking library.

For now it's functional and allows you to mock out methods by returning custom values,
executing a custom function, or throwing a custom exception as well as a custom error message.

Next steps:

- [ ] Add support for calls verification (spy-like behaviour)
