[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@vdstack%2Fmockit.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@vdstack%2Fmockit)

Mockit solves the problem of [mocking the behaviour](https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html) of injected dependencies in Typescript. With its help, patterns like Strategy, or Ports & Adapters, become super easy to unit test. Its API was inspired by Java's Mockito package, but has diverged along the way. Mockito's knowledge is easily transferable though.

Mockit API can mock any dependency:

- functions: `Mock(originalFunction)`
- classes: `Mock(originalClass)`
- Abstract classes: `Mock(abstractClass)`
- Object modules: `Mock(originalObject)`
- Types and interfaces: `Mock<Type>()` or `Mock<Interface>()`

It provides a semantic API that is easy to use, as well **as complete type-safety**, which helps a LOT when writing tests, as it provides auto-completion and type-checking alerting you of any invalid test setup.

```ts
const mockedFunc = Mock(original);
when(mockedFunc).isCalled.thenReturn(2);
when(mockedFunc).isCalledWith("Victor").thenReturn(42);

mockedFunc(); // 2
mockedFunc("Victor"); // 42
```

You can also verify how the mock was called.

```ts
const mockedFunc = Mock(original);
mockedFunc("hello", "world");

// All these assertions are valid.
verifyThat(mockedFunc).wasCalledOnce();
verifyThat(mockedFunc).wasCalledOnceWith("hello", "world");
verifyThat(mockedFunc).wasCalledNTimes(1);

// This assertion is invalid: it will throw an error.
verifyThat(mockedFunc).wasCalledNTimes(2);
```

These verifications are assertive, meaning your test will fail if the mock was not called the way you expected it to be. No assertion library necessary !
They are agnostic of the test runner and assertion library you use.

You can access more under-the-hood features like reading the history of calls.

```ts
const mockedFunc = Mock(original);
mockedFunc("hello", "world");

getMockHistory(mockedFunc).getCalls(); // [{ args: ["hello", "world"], date: a Date }]
```

Finally, you can leverage a whole suite of matchers.

Matchers are a powerful tool to make your tests more resilient to changes in the implementation, and more focused on the logic you want to test.
They can be used both in the `when` and `verifyThat` functions.

Matchers will pass compilation in place of the expected value, which makes them very easy to use.
Matchers can also be combined to create more complex matchers.

```ts
const mockedFunc = Mock(original);

/**
 * Here the matcher m.schema combined with a zod parser can help you create a more resilient test.
 *
 * If the implementation changes anything but the age, the test will still pass.
 */

when(mockedFunc)
  .isCalledWith(m.objectContaining({ age: m.schema(z.number().gte(18)) }))
  .thenReturn("adult");

const response = mockedFunc({
  name: "Victor",
  age: 42,
  email: "vic@vic.fr",
  nationality: "French",
  hobbies: ["coding", "reading", "making music", "video games"],
});

expect(response).toBe("adult");

/**
 * Here the matcher m.arrayContaining combined with m.any.string() can help you create a more resilient test: hobbies values are not important as long as they are an array of strings.
 *
 * Similarly, the m.objectContaining matcher is used to avoid checking properties that are not important for the test: you focus on the age and hobbies properties.
 */
verifyThat(mockedFunc).wasCalledOnceWith(
  m.objectContaining({
    age: m.schema(z.number().int().positive()),
    hobbies: m.arrayContaining(m.any.string()),
  })
);
```

# Mock

You can mock functions, classes, abstract classes, objects, interfaces and types with the same function `Mock`.

### Functions

```ts
function hello() {
  return "hello";
}

const mockedFunc = Mock(hello);
```

### Classes

```ts
class Hello {
  sayHello() {
    return "hello";
  }
}

const mockedClass = Mock(Hello);
```

### Abstract classes

```ts
abstract class Hello {
  abstract sayHello(): string;
}

const mockedAbstractClass = Mock(Hello);
```

### Types and interfaces

```ts
interface HelloInterface {
  sayHello(): string;
}

type HelloType = {
  sayHello(): string;
};

const mockedInterface = Mock<HelloInterface>();
const mockedType = Mock<HelloType>();
```

### Object modules

```ts
// Useful for mocking npm modules !
const userRepository = {
  getUser: (id: string) => {
    return { id, name: "Victor" };
  },
};

const mockedObject = Mock(userRepository);
```

## Interacting with the mocks

Functions mocks are the base of the library.
Every other type of mock (class, abstract class, object, interface, type) is built on top of function mocks.

For example, mocking a class is equivalent to mocking all of its public functions.

Understanding how to handle function mocks in Mockit will unlock any other type of mock.

# when

You can control the mocked functions behaviour using the `when` API. It provides a semantic way to define the mock's behaviour. You get a wide range of behaviour available to you, from returning a value, to throwing an error, to calling the original function, etc...

## Behaviours control

There are two ways to control the mock's behaviour:

- `when(mockedFunc).isCalled` will setup the default behaviour of the mock. If no behaviour is configured, the mock will return `undefined` by default.
- `when(mockedFunc).isCalledWith(...args)` will setup the mock to return a value when called with specific arguments.

You can also use matchers to simplify your behaviour setups and make them more resilient to change in the code under test.

```ts
const mockedFunc = Mock(original);
when(mockedFunc).isCalled.thenReturn(2);
when(mockedFunc).isCalledWith("Victor").thenReturn(42);
when(mockedFunc).isCalledWith("Nick").thenReturn(15);

when(mockedFunc)
  .isCalledWith({ name: m.schema(z.string()) })
  .thenReturn(66);

mockedFunc(); // 2
mockedFunc("Victor"); // 42
mockedFunc("Nick"); // 15
mockedFunc({ name: "Helen" }); // 66
mockedFunc({ name: "Charles" }); // 66
```

## Behaviours

This section lists all the behaviours you can setup with the `when` API's `isCalled`, `isCalledWith` functions.

### thenReturn

`when(mockedFunc).isCalled.thenReturn(safeValue)` will make the mock return the value passed as an argument when it is called.

You can also pass an unsafe value by wrapping it in the `m.unsafe(...)` function: `when(mockedFunc).isCalled.thenReturn(m.unsafe(unsafeValue))`

```ts
const mockedFunc = Mock(original);
when(mockedFunc).isCalled.thenReturn(2);
mockedFunc(); // 2
```

### thenThrow

`when(mockedFunc).isCalled.thenThrow(error: Error)` will make the mock throw the error passed as an argument when it is called.

```ts
const mockedFunc = Mock(original);
when(mockedFunc).isCalled.thenThrow(new Error("yoo"));
mockedFunc(); // throws Error("yoo")
```

### thenResolve

`when(mockedFunc).isCalled.thenResolve(safeValue)` will make the mock return a resolved promise with the value passed as an argument when it is called. This method is type-safe: it will hint you if the value you pass is not a valid return type for the function that is being mocked.

You can also pass an unsafe value by wrapping it in the `m.unsafe(...)` function: `when(mockedFunc).isCalled.thenResolve(m.unsafe(unsafeValue))`

```ts
const mockedFunc = Mock(original);
when(mockedFunc).isCalled.thenResolve(2);
mockedFunc(); // Promise.resolves(2)
```

### thenReject

`when(mockedFunc).isCalled.thenReject(error: Error)` will make the mock return a rejected promise with the error passed as an argument when it is called.

```ts
const mockedFunc = Mock(original);
when(mockedFunc).isCalled.thenReject(new Error("yoo"));
mockedFunc(); // Promise.rejects(Error("yoo"))
```

### thenPreserve

`when(mockedFunc).isCalled.thenPreserve()` will keep the original function's behaviour when it is called, but will register the call history so that you can verify it later.

```ts
function double(x: number) {
  return x * 2;
}
const mockedFunc = Mock(double);
when(mockedFunc).isCalled.thenPreserve();
mockedFunc(4); // 8 : the original function behaviour is preserved
```

This is only possible when you mocked a real module (like a function, a class, an object, etc...). If you mock a type or an interface, you can't use this behaviour since there is no original function to call.

### thenBehaveLike

`when(mockedFunc).isCalled.thenBehaveLike(original: Function)` provides a way to fully control the behaviour of the mock. This is especially useful for complex scenarios, like returning once, then throwing, then returning again. Sky is the limit here.

```ts
let callsCount = 0;
const mockedFunc = Mock(original);
when(mockedFunc).isCalled.thenBehaveLike(() => {
  if (callsCount === 1) {
    callsCount++;
    throw new Error("yoo");
  } else {
    callsCount++;
    return 2;
  }
});

mockedFunc(); // 2
mockedFunc(); // throws Error("yoo")
```

## Setup with matchers

Matchers are a powerful tool to make your tests **more resilient to changes** in the implementation, and **more focused on the specific bits of logic** you want to test. **They're made with the intent to reduce the time needed to code and maintain your tests**.
If you know `jest.objectContaining`, you will feel right at home with Mockit's matchers. In fact, Mockit provides a lot more matchers than Jest does.

For setup, they can be used in place of any value passed to the isCalledWith function.

For assertions, they can be used in place of the expected values in the `verifyThat(mock).wasCalledWith(...)` function.

```ts
// In this test I only care about the age, and id properties of the object passed to the mocked function.
when(mockedFunc)
  .isCalledWith(
    m.objectContaining({
      age: m.schema(z.number().positive().int()),
      id: m.any.string(),
    })
  )
  .thenReturn(42);

// This will match the setup above, even though the name, hobbies, company & nationality properties
// are not checked: the test is more resilient to changes in the implementation and focuses
// on the properties that are important for the test.
const response = mockedFunc({
  name: "Victor",
  age: 42,
  id: "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  nationality: "French",
  hobbies: ["coding", "reading", "making music", "video games"],
  company: "VDStack",
}); // 42
```

For more information about matchers, see the [Matchers](#matchers) section.

# verifyThat

You can verify how the mock was called using the `verifyThat` API. It provides a semantic way to verify a function mock behaviour.
It couples your test code with the module under test implementation though, so use it carefully, when it makes sense to verify a behaviour that cannot be tested by reading the module's returned value (for example, when testing side-effects). **Matchers can help reduce this coupling** (see the [Matchers](#matchers) section).

It can also be useful to test that a dependency was **NOT** called in a specific branch of your code.

## Verifications

You get a wide range of verifications available to you, from checking the number of times the mock was called, to checking the arguments passed to it.
